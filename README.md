## Description

## Testing locally

You need to have Docker Engine and `docker-compose` installed to continue.

In the project root directory:

1. Run `docker-compose build --no-cache --parallel`. This should take 5-10 minutes depending on your CPU and internet speed.
2. Run `docker-compose up`.
3. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the dashboard.

Successfully tested with Docker Engine version 19.03+ and `docker-compose` v1.25+ on Debian 10, Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10.
